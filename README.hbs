# Freedom Editor

Freedom Editor is a lightweight, fully extensible, zero-dependencies, framework agonistic block editor. You can use vanilla code or your favorite framework to build blocks you need.

## Features

### Framework agonistic

Create blocks with vanilla code or with your favorite frontend framework, be it React, Angular, Vue, or lighter frameworks like lighterhtml or Reef.

### Full customiziable and modular

Unlike other block editors, every parts of Freedom editor is modular except its core loading and saving functions. You can extend it and build whatever you want to control editor and blocks behaviors. Sky is the limit.

### Lightweight and zero-dependencies

The core of Freedom Editor is written in vanilla code, and it only weights 1.5KB gzipped, tremendously smaller than other block editors.

### Other block editor specific features

- Predefined block template support
- i18n and rtl support
- Clean JSON data output (You can even define your own data structure!)
